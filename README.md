## Teachable Machine

Teachable Machine is a free and open tool from Google that simplifies the process of training models without the need to write code. The website is used to train machines to recognize patterns or classifications based on inputs such as images, sounds, or movements using a webcam.

******************************
## Features of the website:

- Ease of use:
It allows users to train models through a simple graphical interface, without the need for prior programming or technical knowledge.

- Variety of inputs:
You can train the model on different types of data, such as images, sounds, and movement.

- Training and classification:
Once you upload the data (images, sounds), it helps you teach the model to differentiate between different categories based on the examples you provide. After training, you can use the model to classify new data.

- Simple graphical interface:
The site provides step-by-step instructions to prepare data, train the model, and test it.

- Image Project: To train a model on images.
- Audio Project: To train a model on sounds.
- Pose Project: To train a model on movements using the webcam.
Upload the data:
If you choose Image Project, for example, you can upload images that represent the different categories you want the model to learn to distinguish between.

3- Train the model:
After uploading the images, the site will train the model on the data, which won’t take long.

4- Evaluate and use the model:
Once the training is complete, you can test the model with new data that it hasn’t seen before.
